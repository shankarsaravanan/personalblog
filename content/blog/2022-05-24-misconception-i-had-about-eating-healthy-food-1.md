I used to think that there was no point in eating healthy just to live little bit longer. Instead I could eat whatever I liked and live a little bit less. 

But very recently I have realized that eating healthy is not about living longer. It’s about being the better version of ourselves however long we live. Because anything can happen to anyone at anytime. It doesn’t matter whether a person is healthy or not. But even if we’re living very little and if we’re healthy, we can be the better version of ourselves.

It’s very easy to say to eat healthy food but practicing it, is very hard. I’m trying my best to adopt to a healthy lifestyle. But I don’t think I will fully get rid of eating junk food 😁
